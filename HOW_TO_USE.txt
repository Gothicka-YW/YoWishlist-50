YoWishlist 50 — How to Use

1) If downloading from GitHub: 
- Install and open the popup
- Load the extension in Chrome (Developer mode → Load unpacked → select this folder).
- Click the YoWishlist 50 icon to open the popup.

If installed from Chrome Web Store, you are all set.

2) Main tab
- Limit: Set how many items to include (e.g., 50).
- Scope (optional): Type the list title as shown on yoworld.info (e.g., “My Wishlist”) so the tool targets that section.
- Preview first N: Highlights the first N cards in the target section.
- Export first N (site): Performs an in-page export using the site’s layout.
- Export (crop): Captures and stitches a clean image of the selected grid without scroll artifacts.
- Restore list: Reverts temporary page changes made by Preview/Export.
- Pick card selector: Choose a single item tile to help the tool detect your grid if auto-detect misses.
- Reset selectors: Clears stored selectors so you can re-pick.
- Open template page: Opens https://yoworld.info/template in a tab.

Tips:
- Keep the template page visible during Crop captures.
- If detection misses your grid, use Pick card selector on a single tile, then retry.
- Press Enter in the Scope field to scroll to and highlight the matching section.

3) Share tab (save, upload, and share)
- Saved: Store entries by title (Save/Rename/Delete). The list remembers your last selection.
- Load image: Drag & drop, paste (Ctrl+V), or load a file to stage an image.
- Upload: Sends the staged image to a host and returns a URL (imgbb with your key → postimages attempt → catbox fallback).
- Image URL: Copy the URL for sharing.
- Forum link (BBCode): Copy ready-to-paste forum code. Use the “Include title” checkbox to toggle the [b]Title[/b] prefix.

Save Title behavior:
- Saving an existing title asks to update the entry; choosing Yes replaces the stored image (auto-uploads the staged image with fallbacks if needed).

4) Settings tab
- imgbb API Key: Paste and save; Test key checks connectivity (no upload).
- Max saved entries: Choose 10/25/50/100/Unlimited.
- Theme: Change the color theme; default uses a purple → dark blue gradient.
- Header font: Choose a local font from fonts/fonts.css. Default is “Dancing Script” if available.
- Switch to Share after capture: Jump to Share automatically after export.
- Reset settings: Clears settings (not your Saved entries).
- Import/Export JSON: Back up or restore saved entries and settings (keys excluded).
- Privacy Policy: Link in the footer opens the policy on GitHub.

5) Keyboard and workflow
- Enter in Scope: quickly finds/highlights the target section.
- After export (crop), switch to Share to upload and share.

6) Privacy and data
- No analytics or tracking.
- Data stored in Chrome extension storage (sync) under your account.
- Uploads only occur when you click Upload; third-party hosts have their own policies.

Troubleshooting
- If nothing happens, make sure your active tab is on yoworld.info/template.
- If detection fails, use Pick card selector on a single item tile, then Preview/Export again.
- For API issues, verify your imgbb key and internet connectivity.
