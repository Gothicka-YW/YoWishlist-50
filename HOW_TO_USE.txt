YoCatalog — Quick Start

Full detailed guide: Open the popup → Home tab → "Open Help Guide" (file: YoCatalog_HelpGuide.md). This file is a lightweight summary for Chrome Web Store users.

1) Install
- Chrome Web Store: Click Add → Pin the YoCatalog icon (optional) → Open popup.
- Manual (dev/unpacked): Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select folder → open popup.

2) Core Tabs (Overview)
- Home: Welcome + quick links (Help Guide, Privacy Policy).
- Screen Grab: Capture clean stitched wishlist/template grids. Works ONLY on https://yoworld.info/template. Use Preview Template first, then set Limit and Export (crop). Auto-switch to Wish Lists (if enabled in Settings).
- Wish Lists: Stage an image (paste / drag-drop / file), Upload (imgbb → catbox fallback), Save/Rename/Delete entries, copy URL or BBCode (with optional title).
- Images: Separate image library (independent of Wish Lists). Same staging & upload flow; manage, copy, rename, delete.
- Avatars: Catalog of avatar images with name, group, tags, description. Upload/replace image, search, filter (group, tags), sort, bulk select (delete/export), import/export JSON.
- Settings: imgbb API key, caps, theme, header font, auto-switch toggle, Reset, Import/Export JSON backup, Privacy link.

3) Typical Workflows
- Capture & Share: Open template page → Preview Template → set Limit → Export (crop) → (auto) switch to Wish Lists → Upload → Copy URL/BBCode.
- Add Avatar: Avatars tab → Select image (paste/drag-drop/file) → Upload → Fill name/group/tags/description → Save.
- Manage Images: Images tab → Stage image → Upload → Save entry with title → Later copy URL/BBCode or Delete.

4) Upload Pipeline
- Primary: imgbb (requires your API key).
- Fallback: catbox (automatic if primary fails). Postimages best-effort legacy is not guaranteed and may be skipped.

5) Data & Privacy
- No tracking/analytics; data stored in chrome.storage.sync under your profile.
- Upload only occurs when you click Upload; third-party hosts have their own policies.
- Export/Import JSON lets you back up Avatars, Wish Lists, Images, and settings (not your imgbb key).

6) Tips
- Screen Grab buttons disabled off-site; use "Open template page" if needed.
- If detection misses your grid: use card picker on a single item tile, then retry export.
- Narrow buttons & persistent last tab streamline repeat usage.

7) Troubleshooting
- Export disabled? You are not on yoworld.info/template.
- Upload failed? Check imgbb key (Settings) or connectivity; fallback should auto-attempt.
- Missing fonts? Ensure custom font is loaded in fonts.css locally.

8) Support & Source
- Issues / feedback: https://github.com/Gothicka-YW/YoWishlist-50 (repo name legacy; extension branded YoCatalog).
